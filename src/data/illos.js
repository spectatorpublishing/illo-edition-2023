        "After taking a printmaking class in Columbia's visual arts department, one qualifies to become a “shop monitor.” Monitors watch over the shop during the allotted “homework hours” that printmaking students frequent all week. Monitors are also given unlimited shop access, a huge advantage in getting intensive work done in a timely manner. As a print monitor, I have spent plenty of time in the shop after-hours with the occasional company of a graduate student or two. This illustration, a fabricated memory stylized as “footage,” shows a print in the process on the table at the forefront while the details of the studio's amenities dissolve in shadow."

Bathed in the ambient lighting of vaguely flickering fluorescent bulbs, you are guaranteed to be disoriented when you run into four or five side characters from your life in rapid succession. Dodge Hall's proximity to the grocery store has given me a particular love of the 2 a.m. energy drink run during long studio nights!"

Especially on the day before reviews, many students will camp out in the studio and work through the night into the morning to get their best work forward. As the sun rises and impending deadlines loom, the collective panic of all of the students is palpable, albeit sluggish given the late hour. In all honesty, there is nothing pleasant about an all-nighter. However, these all-nighters with classmates have created tight bonds and special moments I will never forget."

In fact, I did this so often that the owners remembered my usual order, and we would briefly converse in our native Thai before I walked out. Though I spent the majority of my academic career identifying as a “night owl,” I found that waking up early gives me time to breathe and gather my thoughts before the day officially started. I also realized that morning was a great time to complete my many dense reading assignments; the libraries were empty then, and my mind was less foggy."

While you skate, numerous London plane trees encircle the rink, and the Grace Building towers behind them. Afterward, you can peruse the shops of the holiday market or grab a bite to eat before heading back to campus for your afternoon classes."

The fact that it is most definitely too sweet for my Asian taste buds turns it into a guilty pleasure."

Some return to their dorm, ready to settle down for the day with some homework and music. And others head in the opposite direction, down into the Blue Gym of Dodge Fitness Center. Here, both undergraduate and graduate students help each other push out the ping pong tables and start setting them up to play. The sounds of laughter from conversing players, mismatched rhythms of table tennis balls hitting the table surface, rumbling of gym machines, and the cheerleading team in practice fill the Blue Gym."
